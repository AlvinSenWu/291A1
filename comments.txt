aswu commenting on tonkich:
    ER diagrams are generally the same, with missing of arrows for some relationships
    and determining relationship constraint types which I've discussed with Kevin and fixed for his diagram, 
    and the missing of a bot attribute collect_disseminate. Overall, very similar and consistent with my own.
