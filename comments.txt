    ER diagrams are generally the same, with missing of arrows for some relationships
    and determining relationship constraint types which I've discussed with Kevin and fixed for his diagram, 
    and the missing of a bot attribute collect_disseminate, which I realized after as well is missing and written in the group ER.
    Overall, very similar and consistent with my own.

    similar to my own diagram, but missing extra relationship from List to User to include users. Only had one relationship to indicate owner, but not 
    to indicate the users within list. Also discussed minor changes with Alvin privately about certain relationship constraints like between FavouriteList and        creator relationship. Also I don't think the "list_id" attribute is necessary for the FavouriteList entity.
